However, the depth and quality of leadership in the CSK squad cannot be underestimated for long and with the return of a rejuvenated Dhoni in their ranks, the franchise will aim to regain their authority and script another epic journey this season.",

While the next invention hoping to  make a huge impact on our lives and also helping to reduce fossil fuel for countries with changeable climates is a vertical axis wind turbine that produces generates electricity whether it shines or not. Yes human beings are truly ingenius. The simple tweak of having solar panels located on the bottom flat mating surface makes this vertical wind turbine an efficient energy harvester. The project was the idea of  a Norwegian inventor, John Fasting Sørbø from Kristiansand. The energy pole Emotion is perfect for off-grid locations since no grid connection is needed. There are several benefits for not needing to pull a power cable through air or trenching. It will prevent visual littering and intervention with nature, an easyplug and play installation, no electricity cost and grid independence. Bottom line – less hassle. The Emotion can also be installed as a grid-tied solution where the infrastructure already exists, to contribute energy to the grid and simultaneously reduce the owner's costs through plus customer schemes.",
