This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description

Powered by positivity this news site offers features on Buisness, Sport, Economy and Culture.

## Built With

- [Next.js] (https://nextjs.org/)
- [SCSS] (https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started 

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com/drsfieldsIMA/greencycle.git
```

2. Open with a processor of your choice e.g. Visual Studio Code:

```
code .
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

3. Build the static files.

```
npm run build 
```

You can host the static files to your webdomain of choice however it is prefreable to use Vercel to host the final app.
